# Cermati Assesment Landing Page

Demo: https://cermati-landing.herokuapp.com

## Styling
Styling using sass compiled into css stored on `/styles` folder.

## Logic
Animation logic and storage management is stored inside `index.js` file

## Main Content
The index site is stored inside `index.html`

## Assets
All images and icons is stored inside `/assets` folder

## Weird stuff
If you see on `*.scss` files for `background-color` property is defined raw and not from variable. It is because I found it for only background-color property, variable is not compiled properly.

Kindly ignore `index.php` as it is only to make deployment on heroku works.
